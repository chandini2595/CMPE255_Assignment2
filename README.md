**AUTOGLUON**

1. It is an open source automated Machine Learning framework developed by AWS.
2. It simplifies the process of building highly accurate machine learning models.
3. It automates model training and optmization.

**Features of AutoML:**
1. Automatically selects best model for the problem.
2. Creates model ensembles and uses staking techniques, combining multiple models to achieve better performance.
3. Powerful for handling tabular/structured data.
4. Supports Natural Language Processing.
5. Combines text, image and tabular data - Multimodal

**Installation of AutoGluon:**
pip install autogluon

It is possible to build powerful machine learning models with 3 lines of code. Here's an example

from autogluon import TabularPredictor

p=predict(label='class').fit(train.csv)

pred=p.predict('test.csv')

Assignments:

1. **Autogluon for Kaggle:** AutoGluon is a powerful tool that can be effectively used to compete in Kaggle competitions, especially for tasks involving tabular data (classification and regression). It automates many of the steps that are typically involved in machine learning competitions, such as model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and ensembling, allowing you to achieve competitive results with minimal effort.
